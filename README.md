# Multi bomb Hex Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a great game. The though process that you go through when debating where the bomb could be when given little information is exciting. What about bumping the difficulty while still keeping it withing a sane difficulty level?<br>
This is where the multi strength bomb factor comes in. Can you play Minesweeper with the additional challenge of maths? (I believe you can!)
